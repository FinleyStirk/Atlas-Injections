            <h2>Students allowed to use AI, says new uni guidance</h2>
                <img src="images/img1.png" alt="Football">
                <p>The set of principles outlined for GenAI usage among students and staff also draw attention to the 'legitimate ethical concerns' and 'severe environmental impact' around using GenAI
                    The University of Cambridge has released new guidance for students and staff on the use of Generative AI (GenAI), which states students may use AI in personal work.
                    While noting AI may “provide useful responses,” the guidance outlines a set of general principles for the use of Generative AI to best mitigate against “legitimate ethical concerns” associated with its use.
                    Additionally, it acknowledges that the wide variety of study at the University means that “appropriate use is better defined locally by Department, Faculty or College depending on the context”.
                    The newly-released guidance states: “Students are permitted to make appropriate use of GenAI tools to support their personal study, research and formative work.” However, it advises that students should acknowledge AI's use when it has contributed to a significant unchanged portion of the work.
                    Individuals should “always check with a member of staff” or “check specific usage guidance with relevant areas of the University.” For staff, it reads similarly, “Staff are permitted to make appropriate use of GenAI tools to support their own work”.
                    The new guidance largely reflects the university's previous stance on AI, after the pro-vice-chancellor for education told Varsity in 2023 that ChatGPT should not be banned, as “we have to recognise that this is a new tool that is available”.

            <h2>AI doesn’t have to be as frightening as it seems</h2>
                <img src="images/scary_ai.jpeg" alt="Scary AI">
                <p>University life is defined by change—new independence, challenges, and now, rapid technological shifts. Since the 1990s, social and technological progress has accelerated, and the rise of generative AI marks a new era. With 53% of UK students using AI for assessments, universities are grappling with ethical concerns, and some have reverted to pen-and-paper exams. Initially, I viewed AI with scepticism, fearing it would further erode our attention spans and commitment to deep learning. At Cambridge, I learned the value of genuine understanding—of “digging” into knowledge rather than taking shortcuts. Yet, rejecting AI entirely is as limiting as blind acceptance. Change is inevitable, and our task is to adapt thoughtfully. Beyond efficiency, AI enhances educational accessibility, especially for neurodivergent learners, showing its potential for good. Having seen how technology supports those with dyslexia in my family, I’ve come to appreciate its benefits. As we embrace this wave of change, our guiding values must remain authenticity, originality, and creativity—ensuring AI becomes a tool for imagination and growth, not just convenience.University life is defined by change—new independence, challenges, and now, rapid technological shifts.
